            <h3>Freelancing</h3>
            <p>My name is Ethan Logue and I started my freelancing career with Roblox when my roommate Will Creighton
                asked me to make the first trailer for his team's game Kingdom Khaos. Their game would later become a
                part of the accelerator program where I would be asked to create a second trailer to show off the game
                in its updated stage.</p>

            <p>The recognition that trailer received after being presented publicly had other creators asking Will who
                the editor was. Once he told me others loved it, I realized I could create a small business out of video
                editing which has been one of my hobbies for a few years. I joined the scene using Roblox Talent Hub and
                the Discord server RoDevs where I got multiple offers within two weeks. After building up my name I
                started getting better offers and have even worked with creators who have over 20 million visits.</p>

            <p>No matter how much I was being compensated, my work was always to the best of my ability and I would
                fulfill all the creators wishes. I use free cam and OBS to record my shots, and I have even done some
                tinkering in Roblox Studio to get the perfect shot.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>In high school, I took two video production classes where we learned the techniques of filming and
                editing. The editing portion never got too in-depth, but I took it further by learning on my own through
                tutorials online. We learned a lot about framing and what the different types of framing can
                subconsciously imply to the viewer.</p>

            <p>In my senior year, I was a part of my school's TV Studio which would be shown to the whole school during
                lunch periods. My role in the studio was editing the weather. This was done with a team of 6 to 8
                because we wanted to bring some joy and make other students laugh when they watched the program. We
                would usually record for the first 15 minutes of class and the last 50 minutes I would quickly edit the
                weather. Even though I was rushed, I could still turn out a quality product that others enjoyed. I
                learned a lot of editing techniques and effects during that year which heavily contributed to my success
                as a freelancer.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Kingdom Khaos</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This was my first project in the Roblox community that I did. My roommate knew of my ability and thought
                I would be a good fit to create the trailers for his upcoming game. I edited multiple trailers with
                several versions each to accommodate newer models and ideas, while simultaneously improving the quality
                of the trailer each time. I also edited several presentations and smaller clips for the team as needed.

        <button class="collapsible">Crab Royale</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For this position, I was recommended to the owner of Duo Games, Excellence, to edit their gameplay
                trailer by Polybyte. I went through several versions of the trailer before reaching one we loved. I
                added every sound effect in manually to better control volume levels, and added a couple different
                effects throughout to engage the audience.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Obby Legends</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>My close developer friend, Cypraith, started a solo side project to expand his skills and wanted me to
                create a trailer showing off the diverse stages and front-end effects. This project involved lots of
                timing with the music we chose, so I put much effort into perfecting it. A fast turnaround time was
                requested and I got it back to him within two days.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">The Lunch Special</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Fun Valley Games reached out to me to create a trailer for their upcoming horror game, "The Lunch
                Special." I was sent models of the map and tweaked some things to make it more cinematic while recording
                my footage. This trailer was the lowest budget one, but with what I had I believe it came out really
                good. They provided me with some of the sound effects they liked and asked me to find other ones
                completing their vision.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Hoops Life</button>
        <div class="content" id="hoopsLife">
            <p>Hoops Life reached out to me shortly after starting my freelancing career and offered me fifty thousand
                Robux per month for editing TikToks to promote their game and reach new potential players. This was a
                much different style than the trailers I've been making since it was meant to be humorous and match the
                community surrounding the game. I took what I've learned from making trailers and my time working on my
                school's weather channel to create funny edits that still focused on showing off the gameplay mechanics
                and features.</p>
